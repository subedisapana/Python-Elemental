# A dynamically typed language.

#If the type of the variable is checked at the runtime of the code than the language 
#Code will get interpreted/compiled even if it contain error.
#Variable without its type is initialized.
#example: , Python,Js


#A statically typed language.
#If the type of the variable is checked at the compile-time of the code than the language 
#Variable with its type is initialized.
#Example: Java, C, C++

thing = "Hello"
print(type(thing))
<class 'str'>


#Strong-typing vs Weak-typing

#Weak typing is where a language allows you to treat blocks of memory defined as one type as another (casting).
#Languages like C and C++, although statically typed, are weakly typed.
