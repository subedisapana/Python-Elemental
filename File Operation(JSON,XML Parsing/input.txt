Menstrual hygiene is still a closed-door topic in which most people don’t want to talk about. We feel shy and hesitate to discuss what menstruation is and why it happens. Similarly, we avoid talking about menstruation hygiene. I have seen women being awkward and asking if there is any female salesman at the counter while buying sanitary products. And even asks for the newspaper to wrap it so that other people cannot get a sight of it.

Health, education, economics, women’s rights — some of the most pressing issues facing today are directly or indirectly connected to menstrual hygiene and women’s lack of access to basic sanitation. Taking care of your menstrual health is as much as important as taking care of your daily activities. Any type of negligence can lead to a detrimental effect on your physical as well as mental health, so practicing menstrual hygiene is a must.
